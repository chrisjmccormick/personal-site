I read Brene Brown's The Gifts of Imperfection at my wife's recommendation and really enjoyed and valued it.
This book is all about the destructive effects of feeling bad about ourselves, and insights into freeing ourselves from shame's powerful grip. 

++ What is shame?
A discussion on shame can sound very foreign--I sometimes get confused stares when I try to express to people my own struggles with it. 

I think the reason for this is that to discuss shame with each other, we turn our *subconcious beliefs* into an actual dialogue of words. We use language to describe feelings of shame like "I'm no good" or "I don't measure up" or "I'm worthless", but I think many people (myself included) don't actually form those words in our head. It sounds a little crazy and extreme to actually be speaking those words to yourself. 

But, that's not actually how shame works for me. Rather, those statements exist more as feelings and beliefs lurking, hidden under the surface. In fact, I usually have to curl up in a chair with a journal and do some digging in order to *uncover* my feelings of shame. 




Here are my favorite ???? insights from the book.

++ 2. Feeling shame for ourselves leads to shaming others.


If we have a standard for ourself which we must meet in order to feel worthy, then we will have a standard for others as well. But if we see that we are worthy of love as we are, then we can believe the same about others.
