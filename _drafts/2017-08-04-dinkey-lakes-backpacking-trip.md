We drove up Saturday morning, grabbed our permit in Prather, then off to the Dinkey Lakes trailhead.

## Hike to First Dinkey Lake

I loved the wild flowers on the shore of First Dinkey, and I'm glad we camped there if only because it meant I could shoot the mountains and the flowers in the early morning light.

This lake had some downsides, though. The campsites are set back a ways from the lake in a more wooded area, so you don't have the sweeping views of the lake and mountains that you'll see at other lakes. And with all the rain this year, the shore was rather swampy, so we had to walk a ways down the shore to get to a good spot for reaching the water. The mosquitos were worse here than at Island lake, especially down by the lake edge.
