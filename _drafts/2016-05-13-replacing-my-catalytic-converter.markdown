## How it all began
I had a "check engine" light come on in my 2002 Pontiac Trans Am. 

*TODO - Photo of TA*

I brought it in to a repair shop that I like, [Figueroa Auto Care](http://www.yelp.com/biz/figueroa-street-complete-auto-care-santa-barbara "Figueroa Auto Care on Yelp"). They said it'd be $50 to diagnose the problem. They used an OBD-II scanner and got the error code P0420. 

<div class="message">
Lesson #1: You can buy an OBD-II scanner for less than $15 on Amazon and read your error codes yourself! Here's the <a href="http://amzn.to/1YKw7jY">one I bought</a>. My preferred shop charged $50 to check the codes, and I know another place that charges $30.
</div>

This is the code for "*TODO - Fill this in*" http://www.obd-codes.com/p0420

According to the obd-codes site, it is possible that this code could be generated by "A damaged or failed oxygen sensor (HO2S)"

They told me that my driver-side catalytic converter needed to be replaced, and that they would also clean the oxygen sensors in case they got clogged... They wanted $675 for the part and $175 for the labor--$950 total. 

That price tag shocked me a bit... I knew that catalytic converters are just a bolt-on part, so I figured the labor isn't too hard and they're probably marking up the part. I didn't think the shop was trying to rip me off, it just seemed like this was one of those jobs that you could do yourself and save some dough.

# Choosing the converter
I asked the shop about possibly installing a cheaper aftermarket converter, but they were insistent on using the OEM one. 



I recently needed to get the front end of my Trans Am up onto jack stands in order to replace my catalytic converter. It's not entirely obvious where to place the floor jack and the stands, so I thought I'd share a post and video on my experience.


Here are some [instructions](http://installuniversity.com/install_university/installu_pages/sophomore_year/ls1_lift_points.htm) for getting your 4th gen ('98 - '02) f-body up on to jack stands.

I watched this video on cleaning the sensor:

## TODO

    * Is it possible that a P0420 error can be generated by dirty O2 sensors?

## The O2 Sensors
This forum discusses cleaning the O2 sensors. The opinions feel all over the map. Something that's consistently stated, though, is that cleaning O2 sensors effectively is difficult, especially because the part that really needs to be clean (the sensor itself) is inaccessible.

I figured out that the sensors just cost $31 each on Amazon. So I decided to replace instead of taking any chances.

## The Studs

  * I called O'Reilly Auto Parts to ask about replacement studs and nuts, they said they don't carry studs and nuts, but to try calling Higgens Muffler.
  * Higgens Muffler told me they don't sell parts, they only do service. But they suggested trying Santa Barbara Fasteners.
  * I called Santa Barbara Fasteners, they said they could match the studs if I brought them in. I brought them in, but they didn't have them, they told me they don't do much in automotive. They recommended calling the dealer.
  * I read in a forum thread (though I'm not sure if it was an LS1 car) a user claiming that the dealer wanted $120 for replacement studs and nuts.
  * What's the problem? Why are these so tricky to replace?
    * You can't use bolts because the head could easily break off the next time you try removing it (after it's all corroded).
    * You can't use a plain stud because you need a way to remove the stud (the studs have little hex ends to them that allow you to use a socket to screw them in or out)
      * Maybe you could just leave the studs in on one end and never remove them. E.g., never take the studs out of the exhaust manifold.
        * I forgot that the hole in the catalytic converter on the exhaust side is not threaded... So you just need to be able to get the post into the exhaust manifold.
        
Questions:

  * I keep seeing the word exhaust manifold--is that what I've been calling the header?
  * Can I find the part numbers using the Dorman site?
  * Here we go! http://ls1tech.com/forums/generation-iii-external-engine/1335847-exhaust-manifold-bolt-replacement-part-bolt-size.html
    * In this post, they said you could use an "m10 socket cap screw"
      * "Socket cap screw" is the kind used in IKEA furniture, where you insert an allan wrench in the head of the screw.
    * What is M10?
      * (Source: http://www.bikeforums.net/bicycle-mechanics/159147-can-some-explane-bolts-me-m5-m6-m8-what-s-difference.html):
        * "M10" refers to the 10 x 1.5 mm size 
        * The "5" means the bolt diameter is 5 mm. The ".8" means that the threads are .8 mm apart.
        * So M10 means the bolts are 10mm (which is what the guy told me at the fastener store). 
      * (Source: https://www.boltdepot.com/fastener-information/measuring/tpiandpitch.aspx)
        * "Thread pitch" is just a term used to refer to the distance between one thread and the next.
  * I found specific part numbers in the thread, and you can find them on e-Bay motors.
    * "GM 10220453"
  * I remember reading about having to drill out posts or studs... Where did that come from?

## Script

Hey, guys. I wanted to start by showing you what all the parts look like after they've been removed, so you can get a better picture of what I'm working on.

I've got a 2002 Pontiac Trans Am. It has the LS1 engine in it, it's a big 5.7L V8. So my car is a 4th generation f-body, which means it's very similar to any Trans Am or V8 Camaro from around 1998 - 2002. 

This is the stock catalytic converter from my car. This end goes up along side the engine and connects to the exhaust header, and then the other end is connected to the exhaust pipe heading towards the back of the car. 

This project is conceptually very simple. All I had to do was remove the O2 sensors, and remove the nuts holding this converter in, 3 on the engine side and 2 on the exhaust side. Then just install a replacement converter. In reality, I spent a few hours under the car, just because it can be tricky to get a good angle on these nuts, and they're tough to break because of all of the rust.
