If you're backpacking around Blue Lake, there are a number of lakes you can visit in the area. Here's the route we took on this trip:
* Friday Afternoon: Hiked in from *Sabrina Lake* to camp at *Blue Lake* for the night.
* Saturday: Continued on to *Baboon Lakes* and set up camp. Day hiked to *Sunset Lake*.
* Sunday: Hiked all the way back out.

# Trailhead

We left Santa Barbara on a Friday morning at the end of August (8/24/18) and made our drive up. We grabbed our permit and some Taco Bell in Bishop, then drove out to the trailhead at Sabrina Lake. Despite being a backpacking trailhead (and appearing to have abundant parking!), there are signs all over Sabrina Lake Road saying no overnight parking, so we had to park about a half mile back up the road where 168 turns into Sabrina Lake Road.

## Hike to Blue Lake

The trail starts off fairly gentle, overlooking beautiful Sabrina lake.

Before long, though, it becomes a non-stop uphill climb to gain 1,000 ft over a couple miles. It's a beautifully maintained trail, though--look at this set of stone steps!

Blue Lake is a great prize at the end of all that climbing.

Here's the GPS data from our hike from the trailhead to Blue Lake. Note that it includes all of our stops and breaks.

## Hike to Baboon Lakes

From Blue Lake, you can choose to explore one of two valleys in the area. For this trip, we chose the eastern valley with Donkey Lake and Baboon Lakes. 

There is actually a well-worn trail up to Baboon Lakes from Blue Lake that didn't appear on my USGS topo map, but did appear on the paper map we got from the ranger station.

It's a steep hike up, and feels like it might be a trail to one of the peaks rather than Baboon--add that to it being a hard trail to follow and we almost had a mutiny on our hands :).

Here's the route we took. It's a very clear trail up until the last quarter of it--you can see how we lost the trail towards the end.

## Day Hike to Sunset Lake
Down at Baboon Lakes, looking farther up into the mountains, it appears as though the hike would be a moonscape of rocks and nothing else. In fact, there's a gorgeous creek running from Sunset lake down to Baboon.

## Fishing at Baboon Lakes
Half our crew hiked to sunset, while the other half stayed behind and did some fly fishing. They found an unbelievable spot at the base of the waterfall from Baboon Lakes.
