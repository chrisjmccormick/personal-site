I've been exploring the seed 'bigworldcivilization' on Xbox 360 Minecraft (version TU35), and I wanted to share the locations of the villages, points of interest, diamonds, etc. that I've found.

I'm currently playing on version TU35. 'bigworldcivilization' was originally recommended for TU31--I think it's changed since then, but there's still some good stuff in it.

I've found three villages in this map so far...

Village #1
==========
Just to the south east of the spawn point is a small village at (36, 72, 369), we'll call this village #1.

Here are some locations around this village.

Diamond:

* (-44, 4, 400)
* (26, 4, 401)
* (37, 4, 367)

Emerald:

* (-2, 6, 396)

Gold:

* (-65, 18, 396)
* (24, 24, 357)
* (34, 14, 318) - 7 blocks
* (41, 14, 335)

Village #2
==========
Farther north of village #1 is a larger village at (291, 67, 113), we'll call this village #2.

Directly below this village is a long, deep ravine, starting around depth Y 53

Note that I had trouble finding diamond near this village. There's a lot of lava down near the bedrock.

Village #3
==========
And even farther north is a third village at (282, 69, -140), which I'll call village #3.

This village has a blacksmith with 2 diamonds in his chest.


Other things of interest
========================
Entrances to cave systems with exposed resources:

* (119, 62, 27)
* (101, 62, 109)
* (101, 61, 331)

Portal to End (-47, 33, 139)


I'll continue to update this as I find more stuff!
