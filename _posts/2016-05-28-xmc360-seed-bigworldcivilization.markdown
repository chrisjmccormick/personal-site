I've been exploring the seed 'bigworldcivilization' on Xbox 360 Minecraft, and I wanted to share the stuff I've found.

Just to the south east of the spawn point is a small village at (36, 72, 369), we'll call this village #1.

Farther north of that is a larger village at (291, 67, 113), we'll call this village #2.

* (37, 4, 367)

Emerald:
