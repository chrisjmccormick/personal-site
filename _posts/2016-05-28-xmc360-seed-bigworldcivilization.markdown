I'm making a run at the Ender Dragon using the seed 'bigworldcivilization' on Xbox 360 Minecraft (version TU35), and I wanted to share the locations of the villages, points of interest, diamonds, etc. that I've found.

This seed has no less than *five* villages in it! There's also a large abandoned mineshaft towards the upper middle of the map that includes a zombie spawner. 

Note that all of these details are from version TU35 (April 19th, 2016). If another big update comes out eventually that affects the seed generation, this post will no longer be valid.

Here is the world map:

[![world_map]({{ site.url }}/assets/minecraft/world_map.jpg "Screenshot of the World Map")]({{ site.url }}/assets/minecraft/world_map.jpg)

I've grouped all the locations based on which village they are closest to.

Village #1
==========
Just to the south east of the spawn point is a small village at (36, 72, 369), we'll call this village #1.

[![village_1]({{ site.url }}/assets/minecraft/village_1.jpg "Screenshot of Village #1")]({{ site.url }}/assets/minecraft/village_1.jpg)

There is a librarian here who will give you emeralds for paper, so I set up a sugar cane farm. I found some sugar cane nearby at (109, 63, 339).

Just over a nearby hill, there is an entrance to a cave system with a lot of exposed resources: (101, 61, 331)

This village is surrounded by *every* kind of animal--cows, sheep, pigs, chickens, wolves, and horses.

Far down below the village is a skeleton spawner at (45, 18, 359). The chest in this spawner contains iron horse armor and two saddles.

Diamond:

* ( 26,  4, 401) - 4 blocks
* ( 37,  4, 367) - 3 blocks
* ( 50,  6, 367) - 4 blocks
* (-44,  4, 400) 
* ( 59, 16, 369) - 4 blocks (Near the skeleton spawner)
* (  9,  8, 368) - 6 blocks 

Emerald:

* ( -2, 6, 396)
* (-11, 9, 383)

Gold:

* (-65, 18, 396)
* ( 24, 24, 357)
* ( 34, 14, 318) - 7 blocks
* ( 41, 14, 335)


Village #2
==========
Farther north of village #1 is a larger village at (291, 67, 113), we'll call this village #2.

[![village_2]({{ site.url }}/assets/minecraft/village_2.jpg "Screenshot of Village #2")]({{ site.url }}/assets/minecraft/village_2.jpg)

Directly below this village is a long, deep ravine, starting around depth Y 53

Note that I had trouble finding diamond near this village. There's a lot of lava down near the bedrock.

Gold:

* (252, 12, 102)
* (296, 20, 137) - 8 blocks
* (344, 5, 105)


Village #3
==========
And even farther north is a third village at (282, 69, -140), which I'll call village #3.

This village has a blacksmith with 2 diamonds in his chest.
